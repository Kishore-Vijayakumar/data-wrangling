## Problem 1: BMI Calculation and Visualization
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculate BMI and New BMI for individuals based on height and weight.
  - Categorize BMI according to WHO standards and print formatted results.
  - Visualize BMI data using bar plots with color-coded categories.
  - Discuss BMI's benefits and limitations from medical and societal perspectives.

## Problem 2: Bitcoin Price Analysis
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze Q3 2023 Bitcoin-to-USD data (e.g., mean, median, IQR, standard deviation).
  - Visualize price trends and daily changes using line and box plots.
  - Identify days with the highest and lowest prices and count outliers in the dataset.

## Problem 3: Body Measurements and Correlation Analysis
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze BMI distributions for male and female participants using histograms and box plots.
  - Compute basic aggregates (mean, median, IQR, etc.) for BMI.
  - Generate scatterplot matrices and correlation heatmaps for selected body measurements.
  - Discuss insights into gender-based differences and relationships between variables.

## Problem 4: Weather Data Analysis for NYC Airports
- **Tasks**:
  - Convert weather data to metric units and compute daily mean wind speeds at LGA.
  - Identify the ten windiest days at LGA.
  - Compute and plot monthly mean wind speeds for LGA, JFK, and EWR airports.
  - Handle outliers in wind speed data programmatically.
